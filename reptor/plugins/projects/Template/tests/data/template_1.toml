summary = "We were able to identify weaknesses in the web application's session management. The users' sessions were usable without time restrictions and therefore did not require re-authentication at any time. People with access to a computer system could exploit this situation if another user had not explicitly logged out of the application beforehand."
description = """
We could determine that user sessions were usable without time restrictions. This could allow attackers to take over user sessions that were not explicitly logged out beforehand.

This could be possible, for example, by allowing a third person to operate a user's computer in which a session is still active. In addition, it could be possible for attackers to reuse session tokens when they become known (e.g. via log files; locally or on proxy servers, etc.).
"""
recommendation = """
* User sessions in web applications should time out automatically after a certain period of inactivity.
* Depending on the criticality of the user authorization and the application, the timeout could be approximately between one hour and one day.
