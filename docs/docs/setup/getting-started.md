## Configuration

* Have a [SysReptor installation](https://docs.sysreptor.com/setup/installation/){ target=_blank } up and running
* Get an API token at https://`<your-installation>`/users/self/apitokens/
* Run `reptor conf` and enter your data

Enter the project ID of the project you are working on.  
Uploaded notes and files will be stored in the project notes by default (use `--personal-note` to store there).

The command will create `.sysreptor/config.yaml` in your home directory.
