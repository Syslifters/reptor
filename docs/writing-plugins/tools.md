# How to write a tool plugin
## What a plugin does

A plugin can...

* read tool outputs via stdin on `-i` command line switch (multiple files are supported)
* parse them
* format them
* upload as notes, or
* create findings

## Where plugins are located

`reptor` comes with a number of plugins.  
However, you can override any plugin by copying it to the `.sysreptor/plugins` folder in your home directory.

You can do this by running `reptor plugins --copy <module name> --full`

If you copy the entire plugin, it overrides the builtin plugins from `reptor`.  
If you want to override templates only, use `reptor plugins --copy <module name>`.
So you can customize the templates used for formatting the data, while preserving the official functionality of the plugin.

## Create a new plugin

Let's say we want to build a plugin for a fictional XSS-tool.  
We can start off using our plugin boilerplate by running `reptor plugins --new XssTool`.

This will add the file structure to `.sysreptor/plugins/XssTool`.  
This directory is already dynamically included by `reptor`. When you run `reptor --help`, you should see `xsstool` under the section `Tools`.  
You can also call the help message of your plugin by `reptor xsstool --help`.


## Implement a parser

Our XssTool has two output options:

* Plaintext
* JSON

Our plugin already implements some parsing methods and the corresponding arguments:

* `parse_json` (`--json`)
* `parse_xml` (`--xml`)
* `parse_csv` (`--csv`)

As we do not need xml and csv parsing, we can remove the methods. This will also make them disappear in the help message.  
The `parse_json` method will be called if the CLI switch `--json` is provided.  

However, we are missing an option to parse plaintext outputs.  
An example plaintext output would be:

```
https://example.com/alert(1)
https://example.com/q=alert(1)
```

Our parsing method should split the lines and store the result into a list:

```python
def parse_plaintext(self):
    self.parsed_input = self.raw_input.splitlines()
```

This function must also be called. We can override the parent's `parse` method for this.  
Calling the parent method makes sure that json parsing is executed.

```python
def parse(self):
    super().parse()
    if self.input_format == "plaintext":
        self.parse_plaintext()
```

We still need to add a commandline option for plaintext parsing. This can be done in the `add_arguments` method.  
In the course of this, let's delete the `--foo` and `--bar` commandline options of the boilerplate. We don't need them. (Make sure to leave the `super().add_arguments()` call.)

Input formats are mutually exclusive. We want our plaintext parsing switch also to be mutually exclusive. Therefore, we get the mutually exclusive parsing group and add a `--plaintext` switch:

```python
@classmethod
def add_arguments(cls, parser, plugin_filepath=None):
    super().add_arguments(parser, plugin_filepath=plugin_filepath)
    input_format_group = cls.get_input_format_group(parser)
    input_format_group.add_argument(
        "--plaintext",
        help="plaintext output format",
        action="store_const",
        dest="format",
        const="plaintext",
    )
```

The default `input_format` is `raw`. Specify the default `input_format` in the `__init__` method:

```python
if self.input_format == "raw":
    self.input_format = "plaintext"
```

We are now done with implementing our parser. We can test it using:

```bash
printf "https://example.com/alert(1)\nhttps://example.com/q=alert(1)" | reptor xsstool --parse      
['https://example.com/alert(1)', 'https://example.com/q=alert(1)']
```

## Formatting tool output

Now we want to bring our data into a beautiful and human-readable format. SysReptor uses markdown and allows HTML syntax there.

`reptor` uses the [Django template language](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/language/){ target=_blank } with a slightly different syntax for formatting.  

The Django start tags are prepended with the HTML comment start tag and become:

* `{{` becomes `<!--{{`
* `{%` becomes `<!--{%`
* `{#` becomes `<!--{#`

An HTML comment end tag is appended to the Django end tags:

* `}}` becomes `}}-->`
* `%}` becomes `%}-->`
* `#}` becomes `#}-->`

(Find the reason for this later in this tutorial.)

Let's bring the list of our XSS outputs into the format of a markdown table.  
We find an empty template at `templates/mytemplate.md`. We rename it to `xss-table.md` and place the following template inside:

```md
| XSS target |
| ------- |
<!--{% for xss_target in data %}-->
| <!--{{xss_target}}--> |
<!--{% endfor %}-->
```

However, we have never defined the `data` variable.  
This was automatically done in the `preprocess_for_template` method: 

```python
def preprocess_for_template(self):
    return {"data": self.parsed_input}
```

This method is like a second parsing step for preparing the parsed data for usage in a template. You can add entries to the dictionary for easier template processing.

We can now try to format our output:

```bash
printf "https://example.com/alert(1)\nhttps://example.com/q=alert(1)" | reptor xsstool --format 
| XSS target |
| ------- |

| https://example.com/alert(1) |

| https://example.com/q=alert(1) |
```

This gives us bad newlines within the table because the Django template engine leaves the newlines from the `for` loop there.  
We can resolve this by using the `noemptylines` tag:

```md
<!--{% load md %}--><!--{% noemptylines %}-->
| XSS target |
| ------- |
<!--{% for xss_target in data %}-->
| <!--{{xss_target}}--> |
<!--{% endfor %}-->
<!--{% endnoemptylines %}-->
```

## Uploading to notes

If you haven't done this yet, you can now add the configuration of your SysReptor installation.  
Create an API token at `https://yourinstallation.local/users/self/apitokens/` and run `reptor conf` to add all necessary information.

Let's upload our formatted data to the project notes:

```bash
printf "https://example.com/alert(1)\nhttps://example.com/q=alert(1)" | reptor xsstool --upload
Successfully uploaded to notes.
```

If you experience any problems during upload, check if the user has permission for the project ID from your configuration. Use the `--debug` switch for further troubleshooting.

Your formatted output is now uploaded to your project notes:

![XssTool Note](/cli/assets/xsstool-note.png)

Use `--notetitle "My Notename"` for a different title and `--private-note` to add it to your private notes.  

You can also update the default note title and replace your note icon in the `__init__` method:

```python
self.notetitle = kwargs.get("notetitle") or "XSS Tool"
self.note_icon = "ðŸ”¥"
```

### More complex note structures

We can also create more complex note structures, like one note per target:

![XssTool Multiple Notes](/cli/assets/xsstool-multinote.png)

Therefore, we implement the `create_notes` method. In the first step, we group the data by URL, which should result in the following JSON structure:

```json
{
    "https://example.com/alert(1)": [
        "https://example.com/alert(1)"
    ],
    "https://example.com/q=alert(1)": [
        "https://example.com/q=alert(1)"
    ]
}

```

We can do this by implementing:

```python
def create_notes(self):
    data = {t: [t] for t in self.parsed_input}
```

We then use the `NoteTemplate` model for creating our note stucture. Import the model using:

```python
from reptor.models.Note import NoteTemplate
```

Our main parent note is a note called `xsstool`. It is created by:

```python
main_note = NoteTemplate()
main_note.title = self.notetitle
main_note.icon_emoji = self.note_icon
main_note.parent_notetitle = "Uploads"  # Put note below "Uploads"
```

We then iterate through our URLs, create one note per URL and append it as a child of our parent note. Finally, we return the parent note.

```python
for url, target_list in data.items():
    ip_note = NoteTemplate()
    ip_note.title = url
    ip_note.checked = False  # Make note an unticked checkbox instead of emoji
    ip_note.template = "mytemplate"  # Format note using our Django template
    ip_note.template_data = {"data": target_list}  # Provide data for template
    main_note.children.append(ip_note)  # Append as child of parent note
return main_note  # Return parent note
```

We can now upload one note per target as seen in the screenshot above:

```python
printf "https://example.com/alert(1)\nhttps://example.com/q=alert(1)" | reptor xsstool --upload
Successfully uploaded to notes.
```

## Create findings

Creating notes is nice but... We want to automate our report.

The first thing we need to define is a name for your finding and a condition when the finding should be triggered.

We call our finding `xss`. This means, we need to implement a method called `finding_xss`. This method should return data that can be used by Django templates. It many cases, the data might equal the return value of `preprocess_for_template`. The method should return `None` if no issue should be triggered.

In our case, we want to trigger an issue if the list in parsed input is not empty. Let's implement this method:

```python
def finding_xss(self):
    if len(self.parsed_input) > 0:
        return self.preprocess_for_template()
    return None
```

As soon as you have defined a `finding_*` method, you should have an option in your plugin's help message: `--push-findings`.

Now we have to define, what the contents of the findings should be. Find a sample finding in the `findings` directory.  
Rename this file to `xss.toml` to match it our vulnerability name.

The findings definitions are in [TOML](https://toml.io/){ target=_blank } format. Adapt the contents of the file, as needed, e. g.:

```toml
[data]
title = "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
cvss = "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"

summary = """
We detected a reflected XSS vulnerability.

<!--{% include "xss-table.md" %}-->
"""

recommendation = "HTML encode user-supplied inputs."
references = [
    "https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/",
]

```

You can use the adapted Django template language in the fields in the TOML structure.
Note that you can now include templates that we defined earlier as `xss-table.md`.  


We can use our new switch `--push-findings` and create a new finding in our SysReptor report:

```python
printf "https://example.com/alert(1)\nhttps://example.com/q=alert(1)" | reptor xsstool --push-findings
Pushed finding "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
```

It was pushed to the SysReptor server and can be found in the project from the configuration:

![Pushed XSS finding](/cli/assets/pushed-finding.png)

Note that no affected components were added to the finding. We can add the field `affected_components` as a list to the dictionary returned by our `finding_xss` method to be filled out:

```python
def finding_xss(self):
    if len(self.parsed_input) > 0:
        result = self.preprocess_for_template()
        result["affected_components"] = self.parsed_input
        return result
    return None
```

If you now push the finding again, it will not work because a finding with the same title already exists.  
Delete or rename the first finding, push again and the affected components will also be present in your finding.

## Create findings from SysReptor templates

We just created a finding from a TOML file.  
However, if you maintain your finding templates in SysReptor, you might want to create your findings from your centrally managed library.  

That's easier done than said: Add a tag to your finding template in the format `<plugin name>:<finding name>`. 
In our case this is `xsstool:xss`.

![Tag for finding template](/cli/assets/template-tag.png)

We can use the string and markdown fields to insert our Django templates:

![Tag for finding template](/cli/assets/django-template-in-finding-template.png)

The Django templates are now HTML comments. If you manually use your finding templates, the Django templates will not be rendered into your report. This is the reason the modified the Django tags.

Templates from the SysReptor template library are preferred over TOML-templates.

You can now generate your finding from your template library:

```bash
printf "https://example.com/alert(1)\nhttps://example.com/q=alert(1)" | reptor xsstool --push-findings
Pushed finding "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
```

The finding was created successfully. You see from the "T" at the top that the finding was created from a template.

![Finding created from template library](/cli/assets/finding-from-library.png)

If you now re-run the command, `reptor` will refuse to push the finding again. This is because the report holds a finding that was created from the same finding template.
